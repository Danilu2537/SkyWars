# SkyWars

This project is a web game. It features turn-based combat, where you can customize the items used in the game. The game's logic is built around the use of a single instance of a class, known as a Singleton. A Singleton ensures that there is only one instance of the class throughout the application, allowing easy access to that instance from anywhere in the codebase.
